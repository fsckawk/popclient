popclient is a POP2/POP3 compliant mail retrieval client.  It compiles 
and installs cleanly on most systems.  When compiling on SysV-based systems 
you will probably need to add '-lbsd' to the LIBS variable in the Makefile.
I personally have compiled and tested popclient on the following systems:

o	Ultrix 4.2A, 4.3, 4.3A
o	DEC/OSF1 1.x
o	NetBSD 0.9
o	AIX 3.2.x
o	Sequent DYNIX 3.2.x

Others tell me that it compiles easily on

o	Linux 0.9, 1.0
o	SunOS 4.x

Sorry, there is no cutesy 'Configure' script.  You'll have to edit the
Makefile and config.h -- I've done my best to include reasonable defaults
for most everything.

Once the Makefile and config.h are ready, do the following:

o	'make'
o	'su' and 'make install'

and you're ready to go.  Be sure to 'man popclient' -- the man page is 
fairly extensive.

Enjoy!
