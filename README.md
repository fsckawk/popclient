popclient
=========

This repository is the "official" final resting place of the original 
`popclient` source code written by Carl Harris around 1993. `popclient` 
is a very small and simple POP3/POP2 email client that was developed 
in a time before POP and subsequently IMAP became the de-facto standards 
for e-mail retrieval on today's Internet. 

It is preserved here only for the sake of posterity, and almost certainly
shouldn't be used today. You might have read about `popclient` 
in Eric S Raymond's [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/) or in Nick Christenson's 
[Sendmail Performance Tuning](https://books.google.com/books/about/Sendmail_Performance_Tuning.html) and perhaps have been curious to see (or even try to
build) the source. You might also be be interested in reviewing the original [man page](https://soulwing.github.io/popclient/popclient.html).

Around 1996 `popclient` was radically transformed by Eric Raymond into
the `fetchmail` utility. In 2004, [Rob Funk](https://sourceforge.net/u/robfunk/profile/) and others took responsibility for the ongoing maintenance and of
fetchmail, and as of 2013 it was still being actively maintained at
[www.fetchmail.info](http://www.fetchmail.info). If you're looking for 
command-line interface for POP, IMAP, etc, Fetchmail is for you.
