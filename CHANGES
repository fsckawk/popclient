Version	Description
------- -----------
1.0- 	o  Original POP2 development version, term support, minor patches.
1.6	

1.7	o  Added MAIL environment variable support, System V Makefile changes.

2.1	o  First version to support POP3.
	o  First wide release to public at large.
	o  Began maintaining this file of changes.

2.1a	o  Fixed bug in verbose output in POP3 mode.
	o  Changed bzero() on the options structure to account for programmer 
           boneheadedness.
	o  Changed errorneous call in SockPrintf from SockPuts to SockWrite.
	o  Moved error report on socket errors in main().
	o  Removed -g -O0 from CFLAGS in Makefile.

2.1b	o  Changed erroneous fputs() to fprintf() in POP3_OK.

2.20	o  Changed argv[] pointers to point to innocuous junk so that a
	   password specified using -p will not be compromised by the
	   'ps' command.
	o  Radically changed system mailbox handling to use /bin/mail (or
	   equivalent MDA) to deliver user's mail to the mail spool.  This
	   not only obviates the need for MAIL environment variable support,
	   but also relieves the client of folder locking concerns.  Thanks
	   go to Tor Lillqvist <tml@tik.vtt.fi> for this suggestion.
	o  Set up to allow installer to specify the default protocol and the
	   new MDA (/bin/mail) support configuration in config.h.
	o  Typecast call to getpass() to get rid of gcc warning.
	o  Check for INADDR_NONE definition in socket.h

2.21	o  Changed inline function argument definitions in socket.c to easy
	   SunOS compile.
	o  Fixed mail delivery to system mail folder to use _login_ ID not
	   POP mail user ID.
